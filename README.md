- What are the pros and const of having both server and client in one repo but in separate folrers server/ and client/ ? 
considering the purpose of this challenge, I will allocate the entire project in one repository, considering that for large and scalable architectures this is not a good practice, it can become dificult to build separate processes for both client and server, also, it can become challenging to handle colaborative versioning.
